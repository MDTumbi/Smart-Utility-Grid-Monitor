# VoltStream & HydroFlow: Smart Utility Grid Monitor

An interactive, hardware-in-the-loop Cyber-Physical System (CPS) simulating and monitoring real-time smart household energy and water consumption. The system leverages an **unsupervised Machine Learning model (Isolation Forest)** at the edge to detect anomalous telemetry, combined with a **rules-based diagnostic engine** to diagnose specific grid and hydraulic faults in real-time.

Telemetry is streamed directly from a physical **Arduino Uno prototype** over a USB serial connection, processed through a FastAPI backend, and displayed on a futuristic glassmorphism web dashboard.

## 🔌 Hardware vs. Static Mode

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Active Streaming vs. Static View**
> * **Hardware-Connected Mode**: When the physical Arduino Uno circuit is plugged in and `backend/serial_bridge.py` is running, the dashboard is **fully dynamic**. The gauges update every 2 seconds, and the live Chart.js graphs scroll in real time.
> * **Static / Frozen Mode**: If the Arduino Uno is not connected to the computer, no new telemetry will stream. The dashboard will load in a **static state**, displaying historical logs from the local SQLite database, but the graphs and gauges will remain frozen until the serial bridge is active.

## 🚀 Key Features

1. **Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation**: Uses physical potentiometers connected to an Arduino Uno's analog inputs to simulate active power draw, water flow rate, and line voltage. The physical circuit wiring schematic is available at [circuit_schematic.md](./circuit_schematic.md) with a visual layout at [arduino_schematic.jpg](./arduino_schematic.jpg). 
2. **Edge AI Anomaly Detection**: Trains an unsupervised `IsolationForest` model on standard daily usage profiles (morning/evening load peaks, climate-control variations). Classifies anomalies in real-time without requiring pre-labeled training datasets.
3. **Diagnostic Reasoning**: Interprets multi-dimensional anomalies to identify the root cause (e.g., *Appliance Short Circuit*, *Grid Voltage Surge*, *Off-Hours Water Leak*, *Pipe Burst*).
4. **Physical Haptic Feedback**: Transmits severity classifications back to the Arduino. A physical piezo buzzer alerts the user with warning beeps (`'W'`) or critical alarms (`'C'`).
5. **Futuristic Glassmorphism UI**: High-fidelity dark mode dashboard with live-scrolling multi-axis charts, system health integrity gauges, and real-time event logs.
6. **SQLite Time-Series Database**: Automatically logs all historical telemetry, classification results, and root-cause diagnoses locally.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Set Up the Environment
Open a terminal in the project root directory (`smart-grid-monitor/`) and run the following command to create the virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
# Verify Python & uv installation
uv --version

# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Install packages
uv pip install fastapi uvicorn pandas scikit-learn websockets pyserial requests
```

### 2. Start the FastAPI Server
Navigate into the `backend` folder and run the uvicorn development server:
```bash
cd backend
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### 3. Open the UI
Open your web browser and go to:
👉 **[http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)**

### 4. Connect the Hardware (Active Streaming)
Connect your Arduino Uno circuit to the computer via USB, verify it is mapped to `COM5` (or adjust in `serial_bridge.py`), and launch the bridge:
```bash
cd backend
..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe serial_bridge.py
```

## 🔬 How to Test (The Physical Fault Lab)

Once the serial bridge is active, you can twist the physical knobs on your breadboard to simulate real-world grid faults:

1. **Simulate a Pipe Leak**: Twist the **Water Potentiometer** to exceed `7.0 L/min`:
   * **Dashboard**: The Water card will immediately change from `Normal` to **`Unusual Flow`** in orange with a glowing amber shadow.
   * **Diagnostics**: The log table and diagnostics alert will show: `Unusual Water Flow - Unexpected water flow rate detected outside normal high-usage hours`.
   * **Buzzer**: The physical buzzer will start emitting warning beeps.
2. **Simulate an Appliance Short-Circuit**: Twist the **Power Potentiometer** to exceed `10.0 kW`:
   * **Dashboard**: The Electricity card status badge shifts to **`Overload`** in red.
   * **Diagnostics**: The alert shifts to a critical red box: `Power Surge / Short Circuit - Active power consumption spiked, exceeding standard capacity limit`.
   * **Buzzer**: The buzzer will sound a fast, continuous alarm.
3. **Simulate Grid Instability**: Twist the **Voltage Potentiometer** below `195V` or above `250V`:
   * **Dashboard**: The Voltage card transitions to **`Undervoltage`** or **`Overvoltage`** with red glowing borders.

## 💡 System Limitations & Future Scope

This project functions as a prototype/proof-of-concept for cyber-physical utility grids. Here are key engineering areas flagged for production upgrades:

*   **Diagnostic Rules**: The current diagnostic reasoning engine uses basic-level static rules and heuristics (such as boundary thresholds for voltage, power, and flow). In a production environment, this should be upgraded to a fuzzy-logic decision matrix or a supervised multi-label classifier (like Random Forest or XGBoost) trained on actual grid fault logs.
*   **Machine Learning Model**: The Isolation Forest anomaly detector is trained on a synthetic, baseline pattern of standard household usage profiles. The model's accuracy, false-positive rates, and robustness can be significantly improved by:
    *   Training it on months of diverse, real-world smart meter data (capturing seasonal load changes, holidays, and varied appliance signatures).
    *   Employing autoencoders or LSTM recurrent neural networks to better model sequential time-series patterns.
    *   Conducting hyperparameter optimization (e.g., contamination factor tuning) to adapt to different household baseline envelopes.

## 🌐 Large-Scale Application & Industrial Architecture

While this repository is a low-budget, single-point hardware prototype, the underlying cyber-physical monitoring design can be scaled to municipal or industrial smart grids. A production-grade implementation would evolve in the following way:

### 1. Edge Computing & IoT Protocol Upgrades
*   **Protocols**: Instead of a local USB-to-serial connection, smart meters would stream telemetry over wireless networks using lightweight protocols like **MQTT**, **CoAP**, or **AMQP** secured with TLS.
*   **Edge Devices**: Physical Arduino boards would be replaced by dedicated edge-computing nodes (like ESP32, Raspberry Pi Compute Module, or specialized industrial RTUs) that run lightweight anomaly detection locally before sending data to the cloud.

### 2. Scalable Cloud Data Pipeline
*   **Ingestion**: FastAPI and SQLite would be replaced by cloud-scale ingestion engines like **Apache Kafka** or **AWS Kinesis** to ingest millions of concurrent messages from thousands of household meters.
*   **Storage**: Time-series telemetry would be stored in dedicated databases optimized for high write-speeds and analytical queries, such as **TimescaleDB**, **InfluxDB**, or **Amazon Timestream**.

### 3. Distributed Machine Learning
*   **Training**: Isolation Forest models would be trained asynchronously on distributed clusters (e.g., using **Apache Spark / MLlib**) to generate regional usage baseline models.
*   **Inference**: Models would be serialized (using ONNX or TensorFlow Lite) and deployed directly to edge nodes or served as serverless microservices (e.g., AWS Lambda) to perform instant outlier classification close to the sensors.
